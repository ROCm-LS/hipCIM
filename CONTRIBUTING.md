## Code contributions

### Your first issue

1. Read the project's [README.md](https://github.com/ROCm-LS/hipCIM/README.md#build-hipcim-from-source)
    to learn how to setup the development environment
2. Find an issue to work on.
3. Comment on the issue saying you are going to work on it
4. Code! Make sure to update unit tests!
5. When done, [create your pull request](https://github.com/ROCm-LS/hipCIM/compare)
6. Verify that CI passes all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/). Fix if needed
7. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed
8. Once reviewed and approved, a hipCIM developer will merge your pull request

Remember, if you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues
and ask for clarifications!

### Seasoned developers

Once you have gotten your feet wet and are more comfortable with the code, you
can look at the prioritized issues of our next release in our [project boards](https://github.com/ROCm-LS/hipCIM/projects).

> **Pro Tip:** Always look at the release board with the highest number for
issues to work on. This is where hipCIM developers also focus their efforts.

Look at the unassigned issues, and find an issue you are comfortable with
contributing to. Start with _Step 3_ from above, commenting on the issue to let
others know you are working on it. If you have any questions related to the
implementation of the issue, ask them in the issue instead of the PR.
